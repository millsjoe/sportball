## Sportball

I've been wanting to make a new app for a while so im gonna try doing sportball.
A pretty simple app making use of API-Football to let you stay up to date with all things.

I plan to expand past football to really encompass all of sportball


### PWA

At the moment I want to favour doing it as a Progressive Web App. If this changes I'll swap to React Native
